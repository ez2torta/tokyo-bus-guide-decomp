## Introduction
This project focuses on decompiling the Sega Dreamcast game Tokyo Bus Guide. It prioritizes achieving identical behavior between the original and decompiled code, rather than traditional methods targeting byte-level matching. Key objectives include functional equivalence, scalable decompilation methods, and community collaboration in Dreamcast reverse engineering.

To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first public Dreamcast game decompilation project.


## Approach
Unlike traditional byte-level matching, this project uses a custom [SH4 object simulator and testing framework](https://github.com/lhsazevedo/sh4objtest). This tool tests decompiled functions against their original counterparts, ensuring exact behavioral replication.


## Project Status
This is an ongoing project, the decompilation process will be regularly updated. While under development, the project allows building the game using the available decompiled functions.


### Current Achivements:
- Rebuilding the game binary with decompiled functions alongside original code.
- Custom logs from decompiled C files, written to the Dreamcast serial interface and on-screen debug text: [watch video](https://twitter.com/lhs_azevedo/status/1777558619480867048), [view code](https://github.com/lhsazevedo/tokyo-bus-guide-decomp/blob/7cbc8608b7a7568db8e26e9c9302b8a6f983460e/src/011120_asset_queues.c#L1186-L1197).
- CI workflows with matching builds, non-matching builds and unit tests checks.

## How to Contribute
Contributions to this project are encouraged and welcomed! Your expertise in code, testing, or documentation can significantly advance this decompilation effort. Detailed contribution guidelines will be available shortly.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Linux Mint or similar Ubuntu-based distributions (additional steps may be required for other distributions).
- [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) 32.
- Dreamcast SDK (Sega Library) Ver.1.55J (Google is your friend)

## Project Setup
1. Ensure your SDK is organized as follows.
   ```
   „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ bin (From disc Vol.1 dc_sdk/bin)
   „    „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ binadj.exe
   „    „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ ...
   „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ shc (From disc Vol.2)
   „    „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ bin
   „    „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ include
   „    „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ lib
   „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ shinobi (From disc Vol.2)
      „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ driver
      „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ include
      „¥„Ÿ„Ÿ lib
      „¤„Ÿ„Ÿ sample
   ```

2. The Hitachi compiler suite expects some environments variables to be set. Create a copy of `set_kt.example.sh` named `set_kt.sh` and update the `DK_SDK` environment variable with your SDK location.

3. Source your `set_kt.sh` script to make the environment variables available in the current shell:
   ```
   $ source set_kt.sh
   ```

4. Build the binary using the provided `build.sh` script.
   ```
   $ ./build.sh

   (...)

   ```

A successful build will display "Project built :)".


## Docker Container Development

This needs to have Wine32 Installed on your Linux machine prior to running this (at least in the current version of this README file)

1. Open run_container.sh with your favorite text editor and update the SDK_PATH variable with the location of the SDK Files mentioned in the Project Setup

2. Run run_container.sh. you should be inside a bash shell inside /app (your current folder)
   ```
   $ ./run_container.sh
   ```

3. Source your `set_kt.docker.sh` script to make the environment variables available in the current shell:

   ```
   $ source ./scripts/set_kt.docker.sh
   ```

4. Build the binary using the provided `build.sh` script.
   ```
   $ ./scripts/build.sh

   (...)

5. Install Composer sh4objtest
   ```
   $ composer global require lhsazevedo/sh4objtest:dev-main
   ```

6. Run the tests

   ```
   $ ./scripts/run_tests.docker.sh
   ```
